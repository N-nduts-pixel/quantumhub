# QuantumHub

QuantumHub is a Python program designed to help organize and customize desktop icons on Windows for better accessibility and aesthetic appeal. It allows users to save and restore the positions of their desktop icons, ensuring a neat and personalized desktop layout.

## Features

- **Load and Save Icon Positions**: QuantumHub can save the positions of desktop icons in a configuration file and restore them later.
- **Organize Icons**: Automatically organize desktop icons based on saved positions.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple, command-line interface.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuantumHub.git
   cd QuantumHub
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if any):
   QuantumHub does not require external libraries beyond Python's standard library.

## Usage

1. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   python QuantumHub.py
   ```

   This will organize your desktop icons based on their saved positions.

2. **Configure Icon Positions**:
   - Manually update the `quantumhub_config.json` file located on your Desktop to set preferred positions for your icons.

## Limitations

The current implementation uses placeholders for moving icons. For full functionality, integration with the Windows API is required to manipulate icon positions programmatically.
